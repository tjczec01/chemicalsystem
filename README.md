# Symbol Generator

*symbolgen.py* is a Gui based chemical reaction system generator that generates the right hand side (**RHS**) of a chemical system to be used with the [solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) and [odeint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html#scipy.integrate.odeint)  method, the **jacobian**, and the overall equations for each reactions and each individual chemical species. It will generate **Latex** formatted equations for the individual chemical reactions, overall mass balances for each species, and both symbolic and numerical text files for the **RHS** and **jacobian**.

# 1. Chemical reactions

This program will generate the **Latex** forms of each individual reaction and then save them as both a **pdf** and **svg**. The string forms of the equations will be saved in a **text** (txt) file. An example of some inital reactions are given below.

# 2. Overall reactions for each chemical species

This program will generate the **Latex** forms of each individual reaction and then save them as both a **pdf** and **svg**. The string forms of the equations will be saved in a **text** (txt) file. An example of some inital reactions are given below.

# 3. Right Hand Side 


The right hand side (**RHS**) of the system of equations will be generated both symbolically and with initial values substituted into their respective places. This is the required system for scipy's [solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) and [odeint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.odeint.html#scipy.integrate.odeint) method. This function requires a callable in the form of  ``` fun(t, y):```

# 4. Jacobian 

The **Jacobian matrix** is symbolically generated in order to improve the accuracy and speed of the solvers used in the aforementioned method.
