1. Create  list of names as string

2.  Use <<<symfunc(nameslist, number_of_reactions) >>> to get the Chemical species symbols, K symbols, Ea symbols, and Temperature symbols.

3. Use <<<init(Initreactions, Csymbols)>>> to get the reactants and products for each individual reaction.

4. Use <<<eqlist(Eqlist, reactants, products)>>> to get the overall reactions for each individual chemical species. (This also outputs the latex forms of each equations)

5. Use <<<dislat(nameslist, latexs, 'z')>>> to get the the Latex forms of the equations that are used to display and save the equations to pdf/svg. (z is the independent variable)

6. (Optional) Enter desired file path to save the equations as both a pdf and svg
